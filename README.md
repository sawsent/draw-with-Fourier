# The most fascinating mathematical phenomenon I've seen to date
This is crazy to me, the fact that it works, and how simple it is, I was absolutely mind blown after watching a 3Blue1Brown video. I had to code it for myself.
So I did, and the result is mind boggling at least to me. Really enjoyed working on this!
Based on the fourier series, still blows me away that it works, but I understand the theory behind it. 
Instructions: 
1. Draw your own shape, (mb1) it's better if you draw a continuous line, because when computing the constants, order of drawing will be taken into account. Example with 5 pixels: f(0) = pos of first pixel drawn, f(0.2) = pos of 2nd pixel, f(0.4) 3rd pixel, ...
2. Available commands in the Canvas are: C: clear the screen, E: export to the Drawer, S: save file (automatically ads .csv), L: load a file(also adds .csv)
3. Commands for the Drawer: M/N: speed up/slow down simulation speed (buggy).
4. You should play around with the Settings file, change simulation speed, etc according to your needs. You can decide to not show the number line, the vectors, there's some customization available.
5. Wait and see :D!

Thanks! Inspired by a 3blue1brown video.
