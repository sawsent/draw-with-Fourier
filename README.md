### A fascinating mathematical phenomenon
The fact that it works, and how simple it is, blew my mind when I first understood the concept behind the idea. I had to code it for myself.
Loved learning more about Complex Numbers, Fourier Series, and the Python implementation of CMath.
Had to come up with a way to calculate the specific constants of each vector, so I used a discrete function based on the pixels drawn and the order they were drawn in.

Instructions: 
1. Draw your own shape, (mb1) it's better if you draw a continuous line, because when computing the constants, order of drawing will be taken into account. Example with 4 pixels: f(0) = pos of first pixel drawn, f(0.25) = pos of 2nd pixel, f(0.5) = pos of 3rd pixel, f(0.75) = pos of 4th pixel, f(1) = f(0), etc ...
2. Available commands in the Canvas are: C: clear the screen, E: "export" to the Drawer, S: save file (automatically ads .csv), L: load a file(also adds .csv)
3. Commands for the Drawer: M/N: speed up/slow down simulation speed (buggy).
4. You should play around with the Settings file, change simulation speed, etc according to your needs. You can decide to not show the number line, the vectors, there's some customization available.
5. Wait and see :D!
