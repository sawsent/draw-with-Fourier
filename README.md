# A-much-Nicer-Drawing-Thingy
Based on my last project but a whole lot better.
Based on the fourier series, still blows me away that it works, but I understand the theory behind it. 
Instructions: 
1. Draw your own shape, (mb1) it's better if you draw a continuous line, because when computing the constants, order of drawing will be taken into account. Example with 5 pixels: f(0) = pos of first pixel drawn, f(0.2) = pos of 2nd pixel, f(0.3) 3rd pixel, ...
2. You can click C to clear your drawing if you wanna restart.
3. Once you're ready, click E to export to the drawer.
4. Wait and see :D!

Thanks! Inspired by a 3blue1brown video.
